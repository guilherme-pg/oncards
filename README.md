### Packages
* **Body-parser**: used to parse the body of HTTP requests in Express middleware, transforming the request body data into an accessible format for manipulation within your application.
* **Cors**: provides an Express middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing you to control which server resources can be accessed by origins other than the one where the application is hosted.
* **Express**: It simplifies the process of creating web applications and APIs by providing an abstraction layer on top of the native Node.js HTTP server, making it easier to define routes, middleware, and handle HTTP requests and responses.
* **Mongoose**: provides a data modeling layer for MongoDB, simplifying interaction with MongoDB databases by defining data schemas, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and performing data validations.
* **Nodemon**: monitors files in a Node.js project and automatically restarts the server when files are modified.
